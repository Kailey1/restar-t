# restart

Restar-t is an Android app that makes the path to alcohol recovery more accessible and affordable, by providing individuals manageable alcohol consumption goals to slowly taper off their dependency.

When a user creates a restar-t account, they fill in some basic information about their current dependency on alcohol so we can appropriately track their progress over time. After that, they have the option to add a trusted individual’s phone number that can monitor their progress, receiving updates on any relapses. They’re then required to list their 3 greatest reasons for wanting to change. Based on their initial alcohol intake, we design a custom tapering plan with achievable daily targets, to help them reach sobriety without nasty withdrawal symptoms. Even after they reach sobriety, they can continue to track their progress!

Restar-t also encourages the user to reflect on their day and keep track of how they are feeling emotionally as well. Alongside this, the dashboard displays relevant statistics since the start of the user’s recovery, such as their current streak in order to continuously motivate them.

In order to help keep the user on track, every time the user is tempted to relapse, they can shake the phone. This brings them to a page which displays a countdown timer of 5 minutes to resist their temptation. This page also provides the user an option to call their trusted person, a hotline, write an entry in their journal, and reflect again on their earlier answers on why they sought this change.

Another key feature of restar-t is the reflection center, where the user can view and create their daily journal entries. Each journal entry prompts the user for their mood, whether they met their alcohol target, and their thoughts on why they did or didn’t. If the user hasn’t submitted an entry around 10:30PM, then the app will send a notification reminding them to!

Additionally, there’s a feed for users to anonymously share their stories in overcoming addiction that provides a motivational place for users to know they’re not alone in their journey.

Restar-t also features a resources page that can launch Google Map directions to the nearest Alcoholics Anonymous center, along with basic information on alcohol use, services and resources the user can use, as well as other methods they can use to aid them in their recovery.

Regardless, restar-t is not by any means a replacement for professional services like conventional rehabilitation, but rather an alternative for those who have nowhere else to turn to. We researched recommended tapering treatments to addiction and substance abuse from trusted sources like verywellmind.com and drugrehab.com, and explored other affordable techniques that could streamline the process of uplifting those in need.
